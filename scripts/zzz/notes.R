# Time course analysis of writing modality development

# -- Outcome variables
# number of words written
# space use accuracy: 
      # number of correctly inserted spaces – (number of incorrectly inserted spaces + missing spaces) / spaces required
# use of sentence terminators: 
      # number of correctly inserted terminators – (number of incorrectly inserted terminators + number of missing terminators) / terminators required
# number of correctly spelled words
# vocabulary sophistication: a mean score across all lexical-lemmas types in a text reflecting written age-of- acquisition
# syntax (clause construction): sum score based on number of clauses, type of clause (main/subordinate) and whether the clauses are errorfree or contain any syntactical error(s)
# story grammar (narrative structure on macro level): 0 = no story grammar, 1 = two stages (e.g. orientation + complication), 2 = complete story grammar of 3 stages (orientation, complication, resolution)
# number of events (basic story structure)
# number of advanced narrative structures (features like problem, solution, reaction)
# age is measured in months


# Needs the actual couts for space use and terminators
# Add prop corr for spelling correct / number of words

# Discuss what makes a good text
